# Haskell-Game-Jam
install stack from [here](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/)
then do ```stack run``` or simply run the vscode tasks either natively or with the task runner extension which gives nice buttons!

with stack everything installs in its own little environment kinda like docker should be easy to remove later
